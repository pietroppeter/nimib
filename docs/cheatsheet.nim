Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't.
However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting.
Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written
will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting
for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers);
to see the complete list, and how to write the language names,
see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once
