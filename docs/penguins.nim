The majority of penguins are Adelie and they are distributed over the 3 islands.
Gentoo penguins (second most common) almost all live on Biscoe,
and Chinstrap penguins almost all live on Dream.

We can confirm this with the following image taken from the

- as expected body mass and flipper length are linearly correlated
- males are in general bigger than females but there appear 2 groups, possibly related to species
- we have some more NAs (and one '.') in sex column (even after filtering for NAs in numeric columns)
- we can see that sizes of Adelie and Chinstrap overlap, while Gentoo penguins are in general bigger
