`nbText` is a block that displays text. It is the one you will use the most.
You can use markdown syntax to format your text.
The markdown syntax is explained in the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.html).
"""

  nbText: """
  #### Markdown Example
  My **text** is *formatted* with the 
  [Markdown](./cheatsheet.html) syntax.

nbCodeBlock: "nbCode"
nbText: """
You can insert your Nim code in your text using the `nbCode` block.
It displays your code with highlighting, compiles it, runs it and captures any output that is `echo`ed.
"""

nimibCode:
  nbCode:
    echo "Hello World!"

nbCodeBlock: "nbCodeSkip"
nbText: """
Similar to `nbCode`, `nbCodeSkip` is a block that displays
highlighted code but does not run it.
It is useful to show erroneous code or code that takes too long to run.
> :warning: `nbCodeSkip` does not guarantee that the code you show will compile nor run.

Examples:
""".emojize

nbCodeBlock: "nbCodeInBlock"

Sometimes, you want to show similar code snippets with the same variable names and you need to declare twice the same variables.
You can do so with `nbCodeInBlock` which nests your snippet inside a block.

`nbText` only stores the string it is given, but it doesn't store the code passed to `nbText`. For example, `nbText: fmt"{1+1}"` only stores the string `"2"` but not the code `fmt"{1+1}"` that produced that string. `nbTextWithCode` works like `nbText` but it also stores the code in the created block. It can be accessed with `nb.blk.code` right after the `nbTextWithCode` call. See the end of 
[numerical](./numerical.html) for an example.
