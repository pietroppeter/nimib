to be done after merging in devel:

- [ ] leftover fixes/improvements and cleanup
  - [ ] nbFile
    - [x] block
    - [ ] partials and renderProcs
    - [ ] example with a text file
    - [ ] example with a nim file
    - [ ] add example for nbFile
    - [ ] make "Writing File" in nbFile an optional customization
  - [ ] check far/from/home is not broken
  - [ ] test penguins
  - [ ] nbCodeInBlock: use somewhere / test
  - [ ] add also nbAudio, nbVideo? (with new doc examples)
  - [ ] add a nbShell? see #34
  - [ ] rename nbNormalize? (too vague)
  - [ ] frontmatter for markdown backend?
  - [ ] why in index I have to treat differently the inclusion hello.nim with respect to Html vs Md backend? (current code is a workaround since I was not able to make them work both at the same time)
- [ ] check that projects that depend on nimib are not broken
  - [ ] check on windows and linux
  - [ ] nimibook
  - [ ] scinim/getting-started
  - [ ] nimislides
  - [ ] nblog
  - [ ] adventofnim
- [ ] document changes
- [ ] release (name blockMaker)
  - [ ] bump to 0.3
  - [ ] prepare release notes
  - [ ] release
- [ ] follow ups
  - [ ] nim-mustache
    - [ ] access to values
    - [ ] print context

milestone for 0.4: better handling of render backends (release name backendMaker). In particular:

> a big next change would be to use a json data in NbBlock instead of context and generate context during save. In this way you could go back to use multiple render backends at once, document could be made not mutable during save, ... 

other dev notes:

- testing will also be improved (did not notice that ptest is turned off)
- (I could also almost pass to an improved doc generation workflow... - problem with README though...)
- [breaking change] code will be stripped by default (as a sort of normalization)
  - with this change I might able to simplify also tests in tsources? should I normalize in the same way?
- all templates have been moved outside of nbInit (no more unused warning!)
- log will move in newBlock? will it be newBlock(cmd: string, body, blockImpl: untyped) so that I can call a log at the end?
- added render backend as customizable in nbInit
- added a context field to NbBlock (inherits partials from nb object)
- I cannot have the context to inherit also values from nb object (values not exported and there is no derive in nim-mustache for context, I might want to do a PR)
- no need to have a partial field in NbBlock. will render using "{{> " & blk.cmd & "}}" (e.g. {{> nbText}})
- actually a partial field is needed if I want to customize (it could be optional). same for a renderPlan for the block
- but as first iteration (internal to this PR) I could just use the partials and renderPlans in the doc
- later I need to decide if I want them to be Option object (they should be but I never used much that API and not sure if it is worth it) or not
- refactored newBlock to contain blockImpl and other identifiers (nbBlock, nbDoc - will this names clash with aliases?)
  - also renamed to newNbBlock
  - also added simple logging (should I have a whale emoji everywhere instead of \[nimib\]? yeah probably! but maybe I leave it for another PR...)
- not sure whether to use renderPlans or renderPlan for NbDoc (and renderProcs or renderProc?)
- code is now normalized (including newlines)
- minimal testing for nbText and nbCode added (could be improved later)
- note that output currently not stripped and by default it has a newLine at end. should I remove the newline at the end? (we will in rendering...)
- not having mdCfg as global object in renders (I would like to have it as const but did not work back then, should check if it works now)
- can I remove NbDoc.render field? probably yes
- there is no way to print a Context -> follow up PR to nim-mustache
- using develop version of nim-mustache with public values
- these two do not seem very good ideas, but I do want output without newlines at the end:
  - output in context has removeSuffix (with dup)
  - exporting sugar now
  - especially a bad idea to have blk.output and blk.context["output"] different
  - I really should think of an alternative...
- something I do not like is that rendering changes state of doc and blocks. it should not (it could affect a second pass with another backend)
- in fact now write wants a mutable doc
- the moment I have the json backend I might be able to have a non mutable doc (but might not be worth it)
- far from home has likely being broken for a while (replacing partial document is wrong given current defaults)
- blocks in markdown are separated by empty lines
